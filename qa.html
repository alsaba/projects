<h1>Q&A</h1>
<h2>Are You Exposing Your Family to Toxic Fumes from Non-Stick Cookware?</h2>
<p>If you love cooking, one of your favorite kitchen items is probably  your non-stick cookware. If you use your non-stick pots and pans on a daily basis, you may unknowingly be exposing your family to  hidden dangers. That's because non-stick cookware is made using a carcinogenic chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which starts emitting toxic fumes that you inhale every time you cook with a non-stick pot or pan!</p>
<p>At high temperatures, the coating of non-stick cookware will also break down into a chemical warfare agent known as PFIB, and a chemical analog of the WWII nerve gas phosgene.</p>
<p>Your best friend in the kitchen may actually be your family's worst health enemy. It only takes 5 minutes for non-stick cookware to emit at least six toxic gases.</p>

<h2>Safety Over Convenience: How to Kick PFOA Out of Your Home!</h2>
<p>The shocking truth is that AT LEAST 90% of Americans have PFOA in their blood. PFOA is an extremely hardy and stays in the human body for years.
